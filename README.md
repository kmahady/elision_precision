Implements the word phonetic similarity matrix (WPSM), as described in the following paper:

    (1) Hixon, Ben, Eric Schneider, and Susan L. Epstein. "Phonemic similarity metrics
    to compare pronunciation methods." Twelfth Annual Conference of the
    International Speech Communication Association. 2011.

Results differ quantitatively from Hixon et al, due to a variety of differences in implementation, but
seem qualitatively similar.
